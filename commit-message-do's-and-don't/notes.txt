Having a good commit message means I have to be very specific about the changes I have made in the code.

And what makes a 'good' commit message?
providing to the point commit subject and short but descriptive body

when is a good time to make a commit?
Creating new feature, modification, fixing bug, or anything that I think is meaningful.
Getting the feel for good commits require practice.


But when I normally commit I do get any option for body. Where to put that?
Well simply use - git commit
This will open up a new window (if using VSCode), where we can provide a proper subject and body.

Example of a bad commit :- Fixed a bug in the file
This message does not give a clear picture of the bug.

Example of a good commit :- 
subject: add missing alt attribute to image
body: Screen reader won't read img to users with disabilities without this information.



The Seven Rules of Great Commit Message:
    1. Seperate subject from body using a blank line
    2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
    3. CAPITALIZE THE SUBJECT line
    4. Do Not end the subject line with a period (.)
    5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
    6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
    7.Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
