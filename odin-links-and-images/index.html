<!-- 
    ALWAYS PAIR "target=_blank" WITH "rel=noopener noreferrer".
    No Opener: Prevents new tabs from accessing original tab using JS. Prevents phishing attacks and tabnabbing.
    No Referrer: Prevents new tab from knowing where the user came from, which also prevents JS from accessing original page.

<!-- 
    Absolute Link: Always contains scheme and domain-> scheme://domain/path
    Ex: "https://www.theodinproject.com/about"

    Relative Link: Since another page will be on the same site. Domain will remain the same, thats why we only pass /path to the file.
    Ex: "./pages/about.html"
